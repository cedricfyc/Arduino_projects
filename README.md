## Beginner Projects <a name="chap1.1"></a>
### IR Remote Control LEDs + 7-Segment Display <a name="chap1.1.1"></a>
- An IR remote control is used to turn on specific LED lights. The 7-segment display shows which option was pressed on the remote control.
- Inspirations
	- [How to Set up Seven Segment Displays on the Arduino](https://www.circuitbasics.com/arduino-7-segment-display-tutorial/)
	- [Arduino - IR Remote Control](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-ir-remote-control)

### Temperature Humidity Sensor with LCD Display <a name="chap1.1.2"></a>
- A temperature-humidity sensor whose output is displayed on an LCD screen. The humidity level is determined and also displayed.
- **Note**: On hold due to possibly faulty sensor or code
- Inspirations
	- [Arduino Temperature Humidity Sensor](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-temperature-humidity-sensor)
	- [LCD Display Basics with Arduino](https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/electronics/lcd-displays/)


### Joystick Game on LCD Display <a name="chap1.1.3"></a>
- A jumping game realised on a 16x2 LCD display with a joystick switch as jumping control.
- Inspirations
	- Code taken from [LCD Jumping Game](https://www.instructables.com/Arduino-LCD-Game/) and slightly modified


### Countdown Timer Display and Buzzer <a name="chap1.1.4"></a>
- An alarm that rings after 30 s with a countdown.
- Meant to be used in a team project, where after 30 s, arduino sends a boolean to another arduino to stop operation.
- Inspirations
